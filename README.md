<h1>Paul Bernard-Hall</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Full stack web developer, with a background in technical support leadership and training.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Focusing on MERN, but have also used SQL, React-Native, Socket.IO, and the HTML Canvas.</p>

<p>I have been hosting some of my projects and small sites on a Ubuntu VPS with NGINX as a reverse proxy, PM2 for process management, along with Cloudflare.</p>

<p>My priorities are building more with React, learning TypeScript, starting DS/Algos, and finding a job where I can continue to learn.</p>

<p>Outside of programming, I enjoy gaming (which I have streamed a bit on Twitch and YT), weightlifting (I miss the gym!), cooking, and being a dad.</p>
